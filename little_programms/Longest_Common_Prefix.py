# Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

# If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

# Example 1:

# Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
# Output: "fl"

# Example 2:

# Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
# Output: ""
# Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

 

# Constraints:

#     1 <= strs.length <= 200
#     0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
#     strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.



strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]

print(strs[0][0])

i = 0
j = 0
new_strs = ""
base_word = strs[0]
length = len(strs)

print(length)

while i < length:
    pass
